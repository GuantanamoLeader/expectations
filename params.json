{"name":"Expectations","body":"# expectations\r\n\r\n> where less is more\r\n\r\nexpectations is a minimalist's testing framework\r\n\r\n *  simply require expectations and your tests will be run on JVM shutdown.\r\n *  what you are testing is inferred from the expected and actual types\r\n *  stacktraces are trimmed of clojure library lines and java.lang lines\r\n *  focused error & failure messages\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Credit\r\n\r\nExpectations is based on clojure.test. clojure.test is distributed under the Eclipse license, with\r\nownership assigned to Rich Hickey.\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to use expectations in your own projects is via\r\n[Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen). Add the\r\nfollowing dependency to your project.clj file:\r\n\r\n    [expectations \"1.2.1\"] ; clojure 1.2\r\n    [expectations \"1.4.3\"] ; clojure 1.3\r\n\r\nTo build expectations from source, run the following commands:\r\n\r\n    lein deps\r\n    lein jar\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nBy default the tests run on JVM shutdown, so all you need to do is run your clj file and you should see the expectations output. \r\n\r\nYou can test that everything is working correctly by using\r\nexpectations in a simple test.\r\n\r\n<pre>(ns simple.test\r\n  (:use expectations))\r\n\r\n(expect nil? nil)</pre>\r\n\r\n(assuming you've put your dependencies in a (relatively pathed) lib dir)\r\n\r\nRunning your clj should be similar to:\r\n`java -cp \"lib/*\" clojure.main -i /path/to/your/simple/test.clj`\r\n\r\nAt this point you should see output similar to:\r\n\r\n<pre>Ran 1 tests containing 1 assertions in 5 msecs\r\n0 failures, 0 errors.</pre>\r\n\r\nYou can run the examples in expectations with:\r\n`java -cp \"lib/*\" clojure.main -i /path/to/expectations/test/clojure/success/success_examples.clj`\r\n\r\nYou can also run expectations using lein if you install [lein-expectations](https://github.com/gar3thjon3s/lein-expectations).\r\nUse [lein-autoexpect](https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-autoexpect) to automatically\r\nrun when your Clojure source changes.\r\n\r\nYou're now ready to start using expectations as you see fit. There's\r\nnot a ton of syntax; however, you'll probably want to take a quick\r\nlook at the various ways you can write expectations.\r\n\r\n## Colorizing\r\n\r\nBy default, expectations uses ansi escape codes to color output on non-windows environments. expectations also respects a EXPECTATIONS_COLORIZE environment variable - set the var to false if you'd like to turn off colorizing.\r\n[more info](http://blog.jayfields.com/2012/05/clojure-expectations-colorized.html)\r\n\r\n## Success Examples\r\n\r\n[using 'expect', 'given' and 'expanding'](http://github.com/jaycfields/expectations/blob/master/test/clojure/success/success_examples.clj)\r\n\r\n[using 'scenario' and 'stubbing'](http://github.com/jaycfields/expectations/blob/master/test/clojure/success/scenario_success_examples.clj)\r\n\r\n## Detailed Examples with Discussion\r\n\r\n[Unit Testing Examples - Part One (Introduction)](http://blog.jayfields.com/2011/11/clojure-expectations-introduction.html)\r\n\r\n[Unit Testing Examples - Part Two (Non-Equality)](http://blog.jayfields.com/2011/11/clojure-non-equality-expectations.html)\r\n\r\n[Unit Testing Examples - Part Three (Using Values)](http://blog.jayfields.com/2011/11/clojure-expectations-with-values-in.html)\r\n\r\n[Unit Testing Examples - Part Four (Testing Double/NaN)](http://blog.jayfields.com/2011/11/clojure-expectations-and-doublenan.html)\r\n\r\n[Unit Testing Examples - Part Five (Removing Duplication with 'given')](http://blog.jayfields.com/2011/11/clojure-expectations-removing.html)\r\n\r\n[Unit Testing Examples - Part Six (Wrap Up)](http://blog.jayfields.com/2011/11/clojure-expectations-unit-testing-wrap.html)\r\n\r\n[Scenario Testing Examples](http://blog.jayfields.com/2011/11/clojure-expectations-scenarios.html)\r\n\r\n[Freezing Joda Time](http://blog.jayfields.com/2012/05/clojure-freezing-time-in-expectations.html)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2010, Jay Fields\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n\r\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n\r\n* Neither the name Jay Fields nor the names of the contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
