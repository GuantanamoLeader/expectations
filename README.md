# expectations

> because less is more

expectations is a minimalist's testing framework

 *  simply require expectations and your tests will be run on JVM shutdown.
 *  what you are testing is inferred from the expected and actual types
 *  stacktraces are trimmed of clojure library lines
 *  focused error & failure messages
