<a name="doublenan" class="anchor" href="#doublenan"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Double/NaN</h2>

I'm not really a fan of Double/NaN in general, but sometimes it seems like the least evil choice. When I find myself in one of those cases I always hate having to write tests in a way that differs from all the other tests in the codebase. A goal I've always had with expectations is to keep the syntax consistent, and as a result I've chosen to treat Double/NaN as equal to Double/NaN when in the various Clojure data structures.<br />
<br />
The following examples demonstrate Double/NaN being treated as equal<br />
<pre>
;; allow Double/NaN equality in a map
(expect {:a Double/NaN :b {:c Double/NaN}} {:a Double/NaN :b {:c Double/NaN}})

;; allow Double/NaN equality in a set
(expect #{1 Double/NaN} #{1 Double/NaN})

;; allow Double/NaN equality in a list
(expect [1 Double/NaN] [1 Double/NaN])

jfields$ lein expectations
Ran 3 tests containing 3 assertions in 32 msecs
0 failures, 0 errors.</pre>
As you would expect, you can also count on Double/NaN being considered equal even if you are using the 'in' function.<br />
<pre>;; allow Double/NaN equality when verifying values are in a map
(expect {:a Double/NaN :b {:c Double/NaN}} (in {:a Double/NaN :b {:c Double/NaN} :d "other stuff"}))

;; allow Double/NaN equality when verifying it is in a set
(expect Double/NaN (in #{1 Double/NaN}))

;; allow Double/NaN equality when verifying it's existence in a list
(expect Double/NaN (in [1 Double/NaN]))

jfields$ lein expectations
Ran 3 tests containing 3 assertions in 32 msecs
0 failures, 0 errors.</pre>
For completeness I'll also show the examples of each of these examples failing.<br />
<pre>;; allow Double/NaN equality in a map
(expect {:a Double/NaN :b {:c Double/NaN}} {:a nil :b {:c Double/NaN}})

;; allow Double/NaN equality with in fn and map
(expect {:a Double/NaN :b {:c nil}} (in {:a Double/NaN :b {:c Double/NaN} :d "other stuff"}))

;; allow Double/NaN equality in a set
(expect #{1 Double/NaN} #{1 nil})

;; allow Double/NaN equality with in fn and set
(expect Double/NaN (in #{1 nil}))

;; allow Double/NaN equality in a list
(expect [1 Double/NaN] [1 nil])

;; allow Double/NaN equality with in fn and list
(expect Double/NaN (in [1 nil]))

There always seems to be downsides to using NaN, so I tend to look for the least painful path. Hopefully expectations provides the most pain-free path when your tests end up needing to include NaN.
